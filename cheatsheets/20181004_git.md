### Throw away local commits and revert to remote HEAD
[SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5097499/9536012)

Switch to another branch and then delete the local version of the branch you want to rever to the remote HEAD

	git branch -D master

Now revert to the remote

	git checkout origin/master -b master

Alternatively - assuming that the commits are only local you can do

	git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>


### Revert a push to the remote

Keeping local changes

	git reset --soft HEAD^
	git push <remote> <branch>

Discarding local changes

	git reset --hard HEAD^

# Collaboration
Make your commit messages standardized. Here is a [styleguide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) from udacity


## Workflow

You are in a team and you are going to do some amazing work for which you need your own branch to work on and then you will merge your amazing work with the shared branch. Let's look at how to do that!

First create your own branch
```shell
git checkout -b <your_branch>
```
Now do your amazing work!

... lots of coding later

Your masterpiece is done. Let's get it into the shared branch so you can be appropriately applauded.

Commit and push your changes to <your_branch>

...

See a list of all the local and remote branches
```shell
git branch -a
```

check out the target branch
```shell
git checkout <target_branch>
```

Pull the latest changes
```shell
git pull
```

Create a new local branch based on the freshly pulled `<target_branch>` that we will use to squash all the commits in `<your_branch>`:
```shell
git branch <squashed_your_branch>
git checkout <squashed_your_branch>
```
... or just
```shell
git checkout -b <squashed_your_branch>
```
Now merge `<your_branch>` into the new temporary branch you just made
```shell 
git merge <un_squashed_your_branch> --squash
```
Resolve merge conflicts (...) and commit
```shell
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```
Now pull the `<target_branch>` origin into your `<squashed_your_branch>`
```shell
git pull origin <target branch>
```
Checkout the `<target_branch>`
```shell
git checkout <target_branch>
```
And finally merge your temporary branch into the main shared branch
```shell
git merge `<squashed_your_branch>`
```
Force delete the temporary local branch
```shell
git branch -D <squashed_your_branch>
```
Force delete your private local branch
```shell
git branch -D <your_branch>
```
Delete remote private branches if there are any
```shell
git push origin --delete <your_branch>
```
And finally push the shared branch (assuming you have checked it out. If not - do that first)
```shell
git push
```
Thats it! You will now be blamed for all the breaking changes you didn't think about by your team-mates. Have fun!
