# Documentation
> Readability is a primary focus for Python developers, in both project and code documentation. Following some simple best practices can save both you and others a lot of time.

## Comments
Comments are developer notes, intended to be read with the code, but not be included in the documentation  
[pep-0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments)

###Â Docstrings
>A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.  
>[pep-0257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

Docstrings are intended to be used in documentation and therefore have a structure to them:

#### Structure
```py
class My_class(arg1, arg2):
    '''Summary

        Args:
            :param (int) arg1:
            :param (int) arg2:

        Returns:
            :return (int:
    '''

    ...
```
#### Example
```py
class Manufacturer():

    def __init__(company_name, number_of_employees):
        '''Car manufacturer object

            Args:
                :param (str) company_name: The name of the manufacturer company
                :param (int) number_of_employees: The number of employess if the manufacturer

            Returns:
                :return (dict): Dictionary with company name as the key and number of employees as the value
            '''
        ...
```

Docstrings can be used to autogenerate documentation using for example [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) if structured in the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) format.

Here are some [examples](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) from Google.

It is not neccesary to document variables in the docstring if [typehints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) are used throughout the code

### Epytext
Another format like reStructuredText
