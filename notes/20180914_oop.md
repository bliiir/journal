# Objects, classes, inheritance

## Three tenets of Object Oriented Programming

| Concept | Explanation | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [Polymorphism](https://pythonspot.com/polymorphism/) | Polymorphism means that an object that inherits appears to be both kinds of object, the kind of object it is itself and the kind of object from which it inherits. | For example - files have a file.open() method ON them which enables me to open all kinds of files using the same methods - could be .pdf, .txt |
| [Encapsulation](https://pythonspot.com/encapsulation/) | Encapsulation in this sense means that a programmer can bundle data and methods into a single entity.| Private methods and variables |
| [Inheritance](https://pythonspot.com/inheritance/) | Inheritance is the ability to use the data and methods of one kind of object by another AS if they were defined in the other object to begin with. | Tiger is a child of Mammal which is a child of Animal |


## Inspecting classes

| Command | Effect |
|:--|:--|
| ```vars(obj)``` | returns all variables from the object obj |
| ```dir(obj)``` | returns all methods from the object obj |
| ```isinstance(obj, cl)``` | returns True if obj is an instance of cl |
| ```type(obj)``` | returns the type of the object |
| ```hasattr(obj, atr)``` | returns True if the object has |

## Dunder functions
| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| ```__init__``` | This method is run ON object instantiation. |
| ```__dict__``` | The convention (which can be overridden) is that the __dict__ method will return a dictionary of all the objects' variables and their values. |
| ```vars(obj)``` | is a wrapper/alias for ```obj.__dict__()``` |
| ```__str__``` | The convention (which can be overridden) is that the __str__ method will return the object's class name and memory allocation |
| ```print(obj)``` | calls ```obj.__str__()``` and return a dictionary of all the objects' variables and their values. |
| ```__repr__``` | The convention (which can be overridden) is that the __repr__ method will return the object's class name and memory allocation. If ```__str__``` isn't explicitly defined for the object, ```print(obj)``` will print ```__repr__``` |


## Conventions
* Classnames start with a capital letter
* It is considered a good idea to initialize all of an objectâ€™s attributes in the init method.
* Double underscore functions such AS __init__ are called dunder functions
