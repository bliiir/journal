Testing emacs. Why would I use it over Vim?

Vim:
  Pro
    - Is native to the terminal
    - Helps to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome
    - I already know a lot about it
    - Works really well with iterm2
    - Vi is already on all machines
  Con
    - 


Emacs
  Pro
    - I would learn lisp
    - Can be made to work like Vim (Evil mode)
    - Can do almost anything
    - Asynchronous
    - Replaces the terminal to some degree
    - More colors
    - Font sizes
    - I kind of like the menu navigation in Emacs

  Con
    - Runs as a separate app - not in the terminal
    - Does not help with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
