**Officer**: Why do I need an order log locally?  

**Solider**: To be able to have stop and take profit orders locally that do not show up on the exchange

**O**: Is that really important now?  

**O**: Why don't we just submit orders directly to the exchange and execute them immediately instead of building a messaging queue that we will have to redo later?

**S**: Well, I was thinking that we might sell access to the queue via an api or website - and that would be the interface with the order execution for customers as well!

**O**: I really like that idea, but for now we need to show that any of this works at all before we start selling our services and building for that type of scenario.  

**S**: Ok, cool. I am ok with that. Let's build the simples possible solution now.
