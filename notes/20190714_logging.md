# [Logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
In this article we are going to take a look at the logging module in Python. Logging is used to log events in your code to an output channel - typically a file.

**Question**: *Why not just print statments? They work just fine?!?*
**Answer**: *Print statments are great, but logging is more flexible and allows you to timestamp your outputs and pipe them to multiple endpoints - like a logfile and the console with minimum effort. It also allows you to quickly change levels so that you get detailed debugging information in the dev stage and critical or error messages when the code is deployed*
**Question**: *But it looks complicated!*
**Answer**: *It kinda does, but so did print() at some point. Logging is worth it. Let's take a look at it*

### Basic setup
Let's start with the most basic logging setup we can - logging to stdout in the default configuration:

```py
# Import the system module logging
import logging

# Default configuration
logging.basicConfig()

# Log something
logging.warning('my first log!')
```
Output:
```
WARNING:root:my first log!
```
Yay - our first log! As we can see the default level is the WARNING level, but not everything is a warning, so let's look at logging levels next.


### [Levels](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)
There are five default logging levels: `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`.

| Level | Numeric Value | Function | Used to |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `CRITICAL` | 50 | `logging.critical()` | A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running. |
| `ERROR` | 40 | `logging.error()` | Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function. |
| `WARNING` |	30 | `logging.warning()` | An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected. |
| `INFO` | 20 | `logging.info()` | Confirmation that things are working as expected. |
| `DEBUG` | 10 | `logging.debug()` | Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. |

[Custom levels](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#custom-levels) can be added using the method `addLevelName()`

```py
 logging.addLevelName(lvl, levelName)
```

The cool thing about these levels is that if we set our level at for example `INFO`, we get all levels from INFO and above. Like this:

```py
import logging

# Configure to INFO level
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logging.debug('Debugging level')
logging.info('Info level')
logging.warning('Warning level')
```
Output:
```
INFO:root:Some info
WARNING:root:A warning
```
We got the `INFO` and `WARNING` messages, but _not_ the `DEBUG` message. If we set the level to `DEBUG`, we would get all three. This is useful because you can pepper these logging messages accross your code and then change how much of it you output in only one place depending on what you are doing.

### Format
Ok. Great. Now let's look at what information we output with the logger. Right now we are getting the level name and the message itself. It is possible to [add all kinds of info to the log message](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes), so let's add a timestamp

```py
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s:%(message)s')

logging.info('Info with timestamp')
```
Output:
```
2019-07-15 18:51:36,831:Info with timestamp
```
You will want to have at least the logging level in the message as well to understand what caused the log to be made. We do that by adding `levelname` to the formatter and let's add the user as well:

```py
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s::%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')

logging.info('Info with timestamp, level and username')
```
Output:
```
2019-07-15 18:57:33,389::INFO:root:Info with timestamp, level and username
```

### Log to file
Awesome. Now - outputting to `stdout` is great if you are debugging live, but usually you can't be staring at the screen all the time and will want to know what happened while you were away, so let's log to a file instead of to `stdout`

```py
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='logging/my_first.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s::%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')

logging.info('Logging to a file')
```
Open `logging/my_first.log/` and it should have this line:
```
2019-07-15 18:58:51,233:INFO:root:Logging to a file
```
### Separate loggers
So far we've worked with the `root` logger. That can get [messy to work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxmzY9soFXg), so let's step out of the root logger and create a new custom logger.

```py
import logging

# Create a custom logger
my_logger = logging.getLogger(name=__name__)
```
If we run that, nothing happens, because we haven't set the level, format, filename etc. Let's do that now, one at a time:

Set the level using the `setLevel` method on the logging instance
```py
my_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```
Now, we create a custom formatter using the `Formatter` class

```py
my_formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')
```
Next, we create a filehandler using the `FileHandler` class:
```py
my_file_handler = logging.FileHandler(
    filename='logging/my_first.log')
```
We've got our custom logger, custom filehandler and custom formatter. Now we put it all together. First we set the formatter of the custom filehandler to our custom formatter:
```py
my_file_handler.setFormatter(my_formatter)
```
Next we add the custom filehandler to the custom logger:
```py
my_logger.addHandler(my_file_handler)
```
Awesome. Let's log something:
```py
my_logger.info('Custom logger ftw!')
```
Output:
```
2019-07-15 19:25:24,013:INFO:__main__:Custom logger ftw!
```
Sweet - that totally worked. A lot of code to replace your print statements, but it will be worth it because you don't have to add and remove the print statements all the time. You can just keep the logging statements in the code and change the level as appropriate.

Ok awesome. Now we can log to different files, levels using different formatters in different scripts.

Before we wrap up, let's add a second handler that outputs to the terminal so we get both a log file and a output on screen:

It's pretty simple. We just add another handler and set it to use the same formatter and add it to the custom logger



Here is the final script:
```py
import logging

# Create a custom logger
my_logger = logging.getLogger(name=__name__)

# Set the logging level of our custom logger
my_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create a custom formatter
my_formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')

# Create a custom filehandler
my_file_handler = logging.FileHandler(
    filename='my_double.log')

# Create a custom streamhandler
my_stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()

# Set both our handlers to use our custom formatter
my_file_handler.setFormatter(my_formatter)
my_stream_handler.setFormatter(my_formatter)

# Add both handlers to our custom logger
my_logger.addHandler(my_file_handler)
my_logger.addHandler(my_stream_handler)

# Log some stuff
my_logger.info('Double logging ftw!')
```
Output:
```
2019-07-18 18:30:55,853:INFO:__main__:Double logging ftw!
```
