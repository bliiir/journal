## Using Jupyter Notebook with virtual environments
[Using a virtualenv in an IPython notebook](help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/IPythonNotebookVirtualenvs)

Using the virtualenv package

    workon my-virtualenv-name
    pip install tornado
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-virtualenv-name



# Create a new kernel
    source activate ENVNAME
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name ENVNAME --display-name "Python (whatever you want to call it)"

Jupyter kernels are located:
/Users/rg/Library/Jupyter/kernels/env


vim /etc/paths

Q: Right. That's not good. What are our choices then?
A: Well, we can just not use Jupyter Notebooks at all and instead us
