# Git it!

You are in a team and you are going to do some amazing work for which you need your own branch to work on and then you will merge your amazing work with the shared branch. Let's look at how to do that!

First create your own branch
```shell
git checkout -b <your_branch>
```
Now do your amazing work!

... lots of coding later

Your masterpiece is done. Let's get it into the shared branch so you can be appropriately applauded.

See a list of all the local and remote branches
```shell
git branch -a
```

check out the target branch
```shell
git checkout <target_branch>
```

Pull the latest changes
```shell
git pull
```

Create a new local branch based on the freshly pulled `<target_branch>` that we will use to squash all the commits in `<your_branch>`:
```shell
git branch <squashed_your_branch>
git checkout <squashed_your_branch>
```
... or just
```shell
git checkout -b <squashed_your_branch>
```
Now merge `<your_branch>` into the new temporary branch you just made
```shell 
git merge <un_squashed_your_branch> --squash
```
Resolve merge conflicts (...) and commit
```shell
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```
Now pull the `<target_branch>` origin into your `<squashed_your_branch>`
```shell
git pull origin <target branch>
```
Checkout the `<target_branch>`
```shell
git checkout <target_branch>
```
And finally merge your temporary branch into the main shared branch
```shell
git merge `<squashed_your_branch>`
```
Delete the temporary branch
```shell
Force delete local branch: git branch -d <squashed_your_branch>
```
And your private branch
```shell
Force delete local branch: git branch -D <your_branch>
```
Delete remote private branches if there are any
```shell
git push origin --delete <your_branch>
```
And finally push the shared branch (assuming you have checked it out. If not - do that first)
```shell
git push
```
Thats it! You will now be blamed for all the breaking changes you didn't think about by your team-mates. Have fun!
